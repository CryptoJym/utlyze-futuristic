          <h2 class="section-headline">From SolutionStream to Kahoa: 30 Years of Building Software</h2>
          <div class="section-text">
            <p><strong>SolutionStream</strong> was founded in 1996 by Jason Thelin and partners as a technical solutions provider focused on web software development. Starting with just three employees, the firm expanded to full software consulting services by 1998 and grew into a respected organization with over 120 technology professionals. The company has “been in the development game for almost 30 years.”</p>
            <p>In early 2022, SolutionStream rebranded as <strong>Kahoa</strong> — a Hawaiian word symbolizing friendship and partnership. The rebrand came with an internal restructure that eliminated middle management and organized staff into small, cross‑disciplinary squads. Kahoa continues to offer product discovery, design, architecture, development and quality management services, and positions itself as a hands‑on AI‑training partner, leveraging “28+ years of experience” and practitioner‑led programs that embed real AI skills into workflows.</p>

          <div class="section-text">
            <p>Drawing on this heritage, Utlyze was launched as a new kind of venture studio. We describe ourselves as an “AI‑first firm that builds companies by predicting market opportunities and creating them ourselves.” Our approach emphasizes private AI agents that run on‑premises — promising data privacy, predictable pricing and “performance parity” with cloud AI services.</p>
            <p>Our mission is “to help everyone use AI to prosper,” identifying opportunities, validating ideas and building companies that can rival multimillion‑dollar firms. Our first venture, <strong>Vuplicity</strong>, reimagines background checks — reducing a traditional 3‑to‑5‑day process to minutes through AI automation. This blend of old‑school craftsmanship and new‑world AI exemplifies Utlyze’s goal: leverage three decades of software craftsmanship while pioneering the future.</p>

Under his leadership the firm grew rapidly and was recognized on the Inc. 500 list in 2010. He later established other ventures, including the video‑commerce company Kartiva and East Mountain Holdings. In 2022 he launched Kahoa.ai, emphasizing responsible AI integration — helping companies adopt AI while mitigating risks such as bias and privacy issues. Jason champions honesty, transparency and a belief that everyone can win in the AI revolution by working together to create tools that benefit all.</p>

              <h3>James Brady — Scientist and Co‑founder</h3>
              <p class="section-text">James Brady is a scientist focused on researching AI and its interactions with humanity. He believes AI should help humans become truly embodied — self‑reliant, capable and confident — and that technology must serve and empower rather than replace people. At Utlyze he leads research and product development on private AI agents and venture‑studio projects, designing tools that make people more competent while preserving their autonomy. His guiding vision is to build AI systems that amplify human agency and help society thrive in the new world.</p>
